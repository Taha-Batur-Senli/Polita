# Polita
 Polita is a political simulator game set in 1933's Basque Spain, on the onset of the turbulent and bloody Civil War that reshaped the country's history. The players assume the role of a University Rector and navigate through an intense political climate, where each action they take will have consequences, both for them and their country.
